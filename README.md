# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on the length and width of their sepals and petals. This project utilizes the Iris dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is included in the `scikit-learn` library. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which can be one of the following:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 100.00% on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into the model's performance across different species.
